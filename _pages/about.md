Who I Am?
======
I am Liu Hanyu, a third-year undergraduate student majoring in Biomedical Engineering at the School of Medicine and Bioinformatics Engineering, Northeastern University(China). I am set to receive my bachelorâ€™s degree from Northeastern University in 2025 and from the University of Dundee(UK).

My research interests encompass action recognition, medical imaging, and large medical models. I have conducted research in the Human Activity Recognition group under Professor Wang Zhiqiong in the Department of Information at Northeastern University. Currently, I am working with Professor Li Chao at the University of Cambridge on projects related to medical imaging and large models. 

My active participation at top conferences and journals such as AAAI (2024, CCF A), IEEE T-KDE (CCF A, IF 8.9), IEEE T-II (Q1, CCF C, IF 12.3), and EAAI (Q1, CCF C, IF 8.0), along with my experience as a reviewer for various conferences and journals, highlights my dedication to the field. During the winter vacation of 2024, I will assist my research team in completing the NSFC 2024 general project application task.
