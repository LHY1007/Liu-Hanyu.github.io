Who I Am?
======
Liu Hanyu is a third-year undergraduate student majoring in Biomedical Engineering at the School of Medicine and Bioinformatics Engineering, Northeastern University (China). He is set to receive his bachelor's degree from Northeastern University in 2025 and from the University of Dundee.

Liu's research interests encompass action recognition, medical imaging, and large medical models. He has conducted research in the Human Activity Recognition group under Professor Wang Zhiqiong in the Department of Information at Northeastern University and is currently working with Professor Li Chao at the University of Cambridge on projects related to medical imaging and large models.

Publications
======
Liu has an impressive publication record, with two papers published in IJCAI (2024, CCF A) and Physiological Measurement (Q2, IF 3.2). He has also submitted his latest research to NeurIPS (2024, CCF A) and IEEE IOTJ (Q1, TOP, IF 10.6). Additionally, he is preparing several studies for submission to IEEE T-MI (Q1, CCF B, IF 10.6) and MICCAI (2025, CCF B).

His active participation in top-tier conferences such as AAAI (2024, CCF A), IEEE T-KDE (CCF A, IF 8.9), IEEE T-II (Q1, CCF C, IF 12.3), and EAAI (Q1, CCF C, IF 8.0), along with his experience as a reviewer for various conferences and journals, highlights his dedication to the field. During the winter vacation of 2024, Liu will assist his research team in completing the NSFC 2024 general project application task.
